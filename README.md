# AGB-Game-Engine
The goal of this project is to get intimate with the GBA hardware at all levels, creating a custom engine, and with it maybe a few simple games. Along with the engine work, there will also be extensive documentation in the code, mostly so I don't have to look far from it.

This project will mostly be in C, with assembly obtimizations when needed. This will be implemented more in time, but as I'm not yet proficient in assembly, will mostly have to wait.
